***Purpose***

The purpose of this project management application is to collect and track ideas from employees and prioritise their projects to improve team productivity. The Teams and Subscriptions Marketing (TSM) team is responsible for building marketing landing pages for Business to Business (B2B) at Canva. The current problem that they face is their manual process for project prioritisation.

The TSM team constantly gets a lot of requests from other teams globally across Canva to create, update or localise (translate to different languages) landing or existing pages. Every season (3 months period) they have to build a roadmap of all the things that they want to work on which is a complicated process as they always have more work than the team can handle and it’s not always clear what is the most important for Canva. The consequence of this unclear path is that their process of prioritisation of projects can be very chaotic. The team has to figure out how to use their limited time to work on the most important projects that will make a big impact for the company. At the same time, they also have to demonstrate their roadmap to leadership to make sure it’s aligned with the overall strategy of the company.

Our project management application will help the TSM team to collect ideas from various people at Canva and add relevant context/additional information to each idea. The application will also automatically calculate the ICE score that is required by the managers for their decision-making process, and finally send back the manager’s feedback to users to review their projects. This application will let users free from those manual spreadsheets and improve their productivity.

## R4. User Stories

As Francois, Head of Growth Growth Marketing B2B, I want to have a tool to calculate ICE score automatically, so I can use these scores for my decision-making process.

As Yel, Software Engineer, I want to communicate my project ideas to my team, so I need to fill a form and submit it to my team/manager.

As Jessie, Digital Designer, I want to be able to add, edit, and delete my ideas after I submit them, so I can feel free to make any changes in my project design later on.

As Lochy, Software Engineer, I want to be able to view and respond to my manager’s feedback, so I can solve my problems as soon as possible.
